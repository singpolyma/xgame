This is XGame, a cross-platform game development framework based on RubyGame and SDL.

To run this demo you must have ruby and the rubygems system installed, then run:

sudo gem install rubygame

to install the rubygame dependency.  You may need to install build tools, ruby headers, and SDL
libraries/headers in order to install rubygame.  These should be in your software repositories.
