Run `git grep -e TODO: -e XXX: -e FIXME:` to see notes about cleanup in the source.

Items sorted by loose priority under the different sub-projects.
Items ending in ? need more thought / discussion.

== Roadmap ==

=== General ===

* Name has been tentatively selected.
* Get domain and website
* Get people to test stuff as more of it becomes available
* Run contests to get people interested in developing for the platform?

=== For library ===

* Scrollable background (psycotica0 is working on this)
* Board game-style demo + other demos
* Continue to improve self-documentation of code and RDoc
* EventListeners needs to wrap the new event stuff in rubygame2.4 -- the rubygame stuff is ugly raw though (Low priority until rubygame2.4 is official)
* Music/SFX wrapper/demo/tests?

* Python port
* C port
* DOMScripting (aka JavaScript) port?
* C++ port?
* Java port?

== For market ==

* Package Rubygame, Chipmunk, XGame, and demos as *.deb and *.rpm i386, AMD64, PPC, x86 for Windows, and source (singpolyma working on this)
** Investigate/rethink package format extensions
* Set up an APT repository somewhere (on csclub, done. Need to investigate SHA1, SHA256?, also, per-deb PGP?)
** Set up MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and GPG verification
* Write prototype script to install from *.deb, *.rpm, or APT repo (with OAuth support for APT) (singpolyma working on this)
** Test security (only authorized accounts download certain packages)
** Test end-to-end installing a "purchased" game with gratis dependencies
* Get nice installer environment and GUI in C and Tk

== For editor ==

* Prototype editor
** User can add sprites
** User can move sprites around
** User can assign mass, and bind basic controls right from GUI
** User can set backgrounds, air resistance, and gravity
** Provide basic default behaviours (moving platforms)
** Allow binding and storage of arbitrary code in the target language
* Decide on output/storage format (may not want to store as code, parsing is hard)
* Get nice installer and GUI in C and Tk
