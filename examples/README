This is a basic demo of XGame, a cross-platform game development library based on RubyGame, Chipmunk, and SDL.

To run this demo you must have ruby and the rubygems system installed, then run:

sudo gem install rubygame

You must also install Chipmunk <http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk>

to install the rubygame dependency.  You may need to install build tools, ruby headers, and SDL
libraries/headers in order to install rubygame.  These should be in your software repositories.

To run the demo, just type:

./panda
